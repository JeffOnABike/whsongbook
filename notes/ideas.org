#+TITLE: Ideas
#+SUBTITLE: A collection of ideas for future development

* Modes
- Each song should have three display modes

** Singalong
- Lyrics with chords on line above
- This is how the original print songbook is formatted.

** Leadsheet
- Only chords separated by bar lines
- This is how instrumental sections are formatted in the original print songbook (such as intros).
- Lyrics could optionally be displayed below
- Could allow two modes
  - Compact: Takes up as little space as possible (for viewing on a screen)
  - Page: Stretched to fill the whole page (for printing)

*** Implementation
- Could be done in LilyPond using the ~Bar_engraver~
  - Documentation: http://www.lilypond.org/doc/v2.19/Documentation/notation/displaying-chords

** Lyrics
- Just the lyrics, no chords at all

* Integrations

** LilyPond
- Ideally, all instrumental note-based parts would be trascribed used LilyPond syntax (such as bass lines or important solos)
- The notes would be displayed as musical notation or tab (ie rendered with LilyPond)
- The rendered notes could be displayed at the bottom of the chart. Having a fully transcribed intro at the beginning of the chart would be distracting in a singalong context to anyone without an instrument.

** Chordii
- Chordii syntax would be an appropriate option for almost everything I want to transcribe.
- Pros
  - Simple
  - Already exists
  - Designed for a very similar use case
- Cons
  - Cannot be used to generate leadsheets
  - No support for note-based parts (ie what LilyPond does)
  - As far as I've seen so far it only offers verse & chorus differences. I also need bridge and prechorus distinctions.
