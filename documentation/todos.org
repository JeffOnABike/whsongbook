#+TITLE: TODOs
#+SUBTITLE: Tasks for development

* Now
** Support time signatures
- See "You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"
* Soon

** TODO Add instructions for installing locally
** TODO Add test for songs with duplicate titles and artists
** TODO Add test for song filenames
- File name should be artist + ~"_-_"~ + title, with spaces replaced by underscores
** TODO Test that songs have titles and artists
** TODO Add icon
** TODO Support line-initial spaces
- See "Us - Regina Spektor"
* Later

** TODO Change fonts
** TODO Show all metadata on song pages
- Now only the title and artist are shown
** TODO Change navbar to be fixed
** TODO Add genres to TOC
** TODO Make navbar light
** TODO Clean up CSS
- Remove the extra bits from borrowed templates
** TODO Allow filters for Browse view
** TODO Add times to Logging
- logging format handler
** TODO Add search
** TODO Allow transposition
** TODO Add lead sheet view
- Chords only, with bar lines to indicate timing
- This is how instrumental sections are formatted in the original print songbook (such as intros).
- Could allow two modes
  - Compact: Takes up as little space as possible (for viewing on a screen)
  - Page: Stretched to fill the whole page (for printing)
    
** TODO Improve mobile view
- Lyrics fit to mobile screen when possible
- Chorus indentation is reduced
  
** TODO Format for printing
- Add an option to download the songook as a PDF or plain text

** TODO Add better documentation for song syntax
** TODO Log bad URL redirects

* One Day

** TODO Update Python to 3.5.2
** TODO Allow community editing
- Users can suggest corrections or additions from inside the app
  
** TODO Allow transcription of individual notes
- Eg intros, basslines, and other riffs
- Ideally, integrate with LilyPond

** TODO Allow personalization
- Users can add songs to their personal songbook
- Users can add transcriptions of new songs

** TODO Add group singalong support
- A user can create a "singalong" and give it an id
- Then other users can join the "singalong"
- Users could add songs to a singalong queue like creating a playlist
- Users could easily navigate to the song that was currently being sung
* Unsorted
** Max line length
** Better handling for multi chords with no lyrics
** Better handling for chords before lyrics
- Now, I'm adding three spaces before lyrics that are preceded by a code. The goal is to make sure that the chord clearly appears /before/ the lyric. This technique works, but it adds unnecessary spaces in the data. Since this is a formatting issue, it would be better to handle this with css.
** Punctuation
- I think all punctuation can be removed
** Add family friendly mode
- Auto replace certain words with PG equivalents
** Add metadata - related songs
- For example "Wild World" and أوقات يا دنيا
- Could start by hard coding this, and then later try and learn it / scrape it from elsewhere
** Change "pre-chorus" and "chorus" for non-English
- Spanish can have:
  - pre-coro
  - coro
- Arabic can have:
  - ما قبل اللازمة
  - اللازمة
** Reformat "add" chords
- They look ugly
- Consider brackets or superscript
- See "Yoshimi"
** Display all metadata
** Consider different formatting for intros and outros
