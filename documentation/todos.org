* Soon

** TODO Update Python to 3.5.2
** TODO Load all songs into memory on startup
*** DONE Add function to __init__.py
CLOSED: [2016-05-25 Wed 16:23]
*** TODO Test the syntax of all song files
*** TODO Test for suffixes
suffix = {"f": "b", "s": "#"}
suffix[slash_chord[1]]
*** If errors
- Don't render the file
- Write error to log
*** Loading a directory
for file in os.listdir("production"):
try:
songs.append(parse_file(file))
except Exception as e:
log error and move on

** TODO Create script for reformatting Word doc
*** Coverting chords
**** Convert WSIWYG chords to LilyPond
**** Decide on symbol to mark chord insertion points (~)
***** Eg
                       Em           B7
When you're ~down and ~troubled, 
              Em       B7       Em
And you ~need a helping ~hand,
**** Recognize a line of chords
- If it contains more than 4 consecutive spaces
**** Name the file
**** Script should output the final file
  
** TODO Add more songs from the Word doc

** TODO Change navbar to be fixed

** TODO Make navbar light

** TODO Change fonts

** TODO Create artist pages

** TODO Add genres to TOC

** TODO Clean up CSS
- Remove the extra bits from borrowed templates
** TODO Change song title formatting
- Separator should not be "-" since this can occur in song titles and artist names
- Maybe "--" instead ?
* Later

** TODO Allow transposition

** TODO Add lead sheet view
- Chords only, with bar lines to indicate timing
- This is how instrumental sections are formatted in the original print songbook (such as intros).
- Could allow two modes
  - Compact: Takes up as little space as possible (for viewing on a screen)
  - Page: Stretched to fill the whole page (for printing)
    
** TODO Improve mobile view
- Lyrics fit to mobile screen when possible
- Chorus indentation is reduced
  
** TODO Format for printing
- Add an option to download the songook as a PDF or plain text

** TODO Add better documentation for song syntax
* One Day

** TODO Allow community editing
- Users can suggest corrections or additions from inside the app
  
** TODO Allow transcription of individual notes
- Eg intros, basslines, and other riffs
- Ideally, integrate with LilyPond

** TODO Allow personalization
- Users can add songs to their personal songbook
- Users can add transcriptions of new songs

** TODO Add group singalong support
- A user can create a "singalong" and give it an id
- Then other users can join the "singalong"
- Users could add songs to a singalong queue like creating a playlist
- Users could easily navigate to the song that was currently being sung
