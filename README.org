* Mission
The West House Songbook is an open-source songbook. Its mission is to provide simple transcriptions of lyrics and chords to pop and folk songs for group singalongs. It began as a Word document, and in the early stages of conversion into a web app.

* Browsing
To view the songbook go to [[http://whsongbook.jasonreeder.com/][whsongbook.jasonreeder.com]].

* Contributing
Corrections, suggestions, additions, and other contributions are welcome. At the moment, pull requests are the best means for contributing.

The source code for the songs is available in the directory [[file:songs/production][songs/production/]], and any changes to the chords or lyrics there will be reflected in the app.

Notes for future work are documented and organized in [[file:documentation/todos.org][documentation/todos.org]].

* Syntax
The songs are documented in a basic syntax following these parameters:
- Lyrics are displayed as written. Currently no markup is supported.
- Chords are written in the syntax defined by LilyPond, a spectacular music engraving markup language:
  - LilyPond ~chord-mode~ syntax: [[http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.19/Documentation/notation/chord-mode][LilyPond documentation]]
- For a chord to be aligned above a given word, that chord should be in brackets immediately preceding it:
  : [c]Love of mine some day [a:m]you will die
  - This syntax was inspired by Chordii
- Metadata is documented in line with Python variable definitions:
  : title = "I Will Follow You Into the Dark"
  : artist = "Death Cab for Cutie"
  : capo = 5
  : year = 2005
  : genres = ["indie"]

The Emacs Major Mode provides basic syntax highlighting in line with the specifications above: [[file:emacs_major-mode/song-mode.lisp][song-mode.lisp]].

* Acknowledgments
This songbook was born out of the West House community, and if it weren't for so many open dinners and Friday singalongs, I would have had neither the idea nor the motivation to put in so many hours to improve the book.

For song transcription, I'm grateful to those members of West House who first began the songbook and those who have helped me to expand it.

The mason jar illustration was created by Marguerite Preston. For more about her writing and her baking see [[margueritepreston.com][http://margueritepreston.com/]].

I have Chris Angelico (aka Rosuav) to thank for many hours of Python mentorship and for defining, editing, and correcting much of the digital machinery. More about Rosuav: [[https://github.com/rosuav][github.com/rosuav]].

As mentioned in ~Syntax~ above, particulars of the song markup syntax were inspired by LilyPond and Chordii. More info about LilyPond: [[http://lilypond.org/][lilypond.org]]. More info about Chordii: [[http://www.vromans.org/johan/projects/Chordii/chordpro/][vromans.org]].

I first learned about folk fakebooks at the Lair of the Golden Bear, and I modeled my own work here on the Lair Songbook. More about the Lair: [[http://alumni.berkeley.edu/lair][alumni.berkeley.edu]].
