        <h3>Acknowledgments</h3>
            <p>This songbook was born out of the West House community, and if it weren't for so many open dinners and Friday singalongs, I would have had neither the idea nor the motivation to put in so many hours to improve the book. More about West House: <a href="https://brownwesthouse.wordpress.com/">brownwesthouse.wordpress.com</a>.</p><br>

            <p>For song transcription, I'm grateful to John Keller for starting the songbook, and to Emilie Lygren for her transcriptions and editing. </p><br>

            <p>For the development, I have Chris Angelico aka Rosuav to thank for many hours of mentorship and for defining, editing, and correcting much of the digital machinery. More about Rosuav: <a href="https://github.com/rosuav">github.com/rosuav</a>.</p><br>

            <p>Particulars of the song markup syntax were inspired by LilyPond and Chordii. More info about LilyPond: <a href="http://lilypond.org/">lilypond.org</a>. More info about Chordii: <a href="http://www.vromans.org/johan/projects/Chordii/chordpro/">vromans.org</a>.</p><br>

            <p>I first learned about folk fakebooks at the Lair of the Golden Bear, and I modeled my own work here on the Lair Songbook. More about the Lair: <a href="http://alumni.berkeley.edu/lair">alumni.berkeley.edu</a>.</p><br>
