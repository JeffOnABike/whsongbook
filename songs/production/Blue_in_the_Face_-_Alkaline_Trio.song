instrumental:
    [| e | e:sus4 | (x4)]

verse:
    Its about [e:5]time, [e:4] [e:3] [e:4]   that [cs:5.5+]I came [cs:5]clean with [a:5]you
    No longer fine,          I'm no longer running smooth
    I thought that I         found myself on to something new
    Just one more [e:5]line [e:4] [e:3] [e:4]   I repeat [cs:5.5+]over and [cs:5]over a[b]gain

chorus:
    Till I'm blue in the [a:sus2]face with a [e]choking re[b]gret
    Cause I talked in [a:sus2]circles 'round [e]you on my [b]bed
    Can't say I [a:sus2]blame you one [e]bit when you [b]kept it all
    In[gs:5.5+]side      [a:5]   when you [b:5]left that [e]night

instrumental:
    [| e:5 e:4 | e:3 e:4 | cs:5.5+ cs:5 | a:5 |]

verse:
    Its about time, that you got sick of me
    No longer fun, and so far from interesting
    I thought that I found me a cure for feeling old
    Just one more line to keep me sleeping loudly and cold

chorus:
    In disgrace with a shameful regret
    As I talk in tongues to myself in my bed
    Can't say I blame you one bit when you kept it all
    Inside, when you left that night

instrumental:
    [| e | e:sus4 | e | e:sus4 |]

bridge:
    And [e:5]all that followed [ds:5.5+]fell, like [b]mercury to [a]hell
    So now we lost our heads for the last time
    And all that followed fell, like mercury to hell
    So now we lost our heads for the last time

outro:
    And [e]I don't [e:sus]dream since [e]I quit [gs:5.5+]sleeping [a:5]
    And I haven't slept since I met you
    And you can't breathe without coughing in daytime
    Neither can [b]I       so what do you say?
    [a]   [b]   Your coffin or [e]mine?
