chorus:
    [g]Lord, I was [f]born a ramblin' [g]man
    [g]Trying to make a living and [c]doing the best I [d]can
    [c]When it's time for [g]leaving, I [e:m]hope you'll under[c]stand
    [g]   That I was [d]born a rambling [g]man

verse:
    My father was a gambler down in Georgia
    He wound up on the wrong end of a gun
    And I was born in the back seat of a Greyhound bus
    Rolling down highway forty-one

chorus

verse:
    I'm on my way to New Orleans this morning
    Leaving out of Nashville, Tennessee
    They're always having a good time down on the bayou, Lord
    Them delta women think the world of me
