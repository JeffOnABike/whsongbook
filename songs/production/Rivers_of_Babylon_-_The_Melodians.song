verse:
    By the rivers of [g]Babylon, where we sat [g]down
    And there we [d]wept, when we remembered [g]Zion

chorus:
    For the wicked [g]carried us away cap[g]tivity
    Re[c]quired from us a [g]song
    [g]How can we sing King Alpha's song in a [d]strange [g]land?

bridge:
    So let the [d]words of our [d]mouths
    And the medi[g]tations of our [d]hearts
    Be ac[g]ceptable in Thy [d]sight
    Here to[g]night [g]
