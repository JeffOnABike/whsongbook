verse:
    You are [e:m]   my [c]fire, [g]   my one [e:m]   de[c]sire [g]
    Be[e:m]lieve when [c]I [g]say, [e:m]   I want it [d]that [g]way

    But we are two worlds apart, can't reach to your heart
    When you say, I want it that way

    (Tell me [c]why) Ain't nothing but a [d]heart[e:m]ache
    (Tell me [c]why) Ain't nothing but a [d]mis[e:m]take
    (Tell me [c]why) I never wanna [d]hear you [g]say
    [e:m]I want it [d]that [g]way

    [e:m]Now I can see that we're [e:m7]falling apart
    From the [c]way that it used to [a:m]be  ([d]yeah)

    That [c]deep down inside of [g]me [d]

    (Tell me why) Ain't nothing but a heartache
    (Tell me why) Ain't nothing but a mistake

    'Cause [fs:m]I want it [e]that [a]way
