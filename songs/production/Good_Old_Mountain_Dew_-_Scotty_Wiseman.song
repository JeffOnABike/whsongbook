verse:
    There's a [a]big hollow tree down the [a]road here from me
    Where you [d]lay down a dollar or [a]two
    You [a]stroll 'round the bend and you [a]come back again
    There's a [a]jug full of [e]good old mountain [a]dew

    They call it that mountain dew
    And them that refuse it are few
    I'll hush up my mug if you fill up my jug
    With that good old mountain dew
