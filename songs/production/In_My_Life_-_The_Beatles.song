interlude:
    [| g g:sus g | d | (x2)|]

verse:
    There are [g]places [d]I'll [e:m]remember  [g:7]
    All my [c]li-[c:m]ife though [g]some have changed
    Some for[g]ever [d]not for [e:m]better [g:7]
    Some have [c]go-[c:m]one, and [g]some remain

chorus:
    All these [e:m]places have their [c]moments
    With [f]lovers and friends, I [g]still can recall
    Some are [e:m]dead and some are [a:7]living
    In [c]my [c:m]life, I've [g]loved them all

verse:
    But of all these friends and lovers
    There is no one compared with you
    And these memories lose their meaning
    When I think of love as something new

chorus:
    Though I know I'll never lose affection
    For people and things that went before
    I know I'll often stop and think about them
    In my life I'll love you more
    In my life I'll love you more
