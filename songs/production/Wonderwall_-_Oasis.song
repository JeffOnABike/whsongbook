verse:
    [e:m7]   Today is [g]gonna be the day that they're [d:sus4]gonna throw it back to [a:7sus4]you
    [e:m7]   By now you [g]should've somehow rea[d:sus4]lized what you gotta [a:7sus4]do
    [e:m7]   I don't believe that [g]anybody [d:sus4]feels the way I [a:7sus4]do about you [c:add9]now [d:add9 e:m7]

verse:
    Backbeat the word was on the street that the fire in your heart is out
    I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
    I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

pre-chorus:
    And [c:add9]all the roads we [d:sus4]have to walk along are [e:m7]winding
    And [c:add9]all the lights that [d:sus4]lead us there are [e:m7]blinding
    [c:add9]   There are many [d:sus4]things that I would [g]like to [g:/fs]say to [e:m7]you but I don't know [a:7sus4]how

verse:
    Because [c:add9]maybe [e:m7 g]
    You're [e:m7]gonna be the one that [c:add9]saves me [e:m7 g]
    And [e:m7]after [c:add9]all [e:m7 g]
    You're my [e:m7]wonder[c:add9]wall [e:m7 g e:m7]

verse:
    Today was gonna be the day but they'll never throw it back to you
    By now you should've somehow realized what you're not to do
    I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
