verse:
    [a]Some bright morning [a]when this life is over
    [d]I'll fly a[a]way
    [a]To that home on [a]God's celestial shore
    [e]I'll fly a[a]way

chorus:
    [a]I'll fly a[a]way, oh glory
    [d]I'll fly a[a]way (in the morning)
    [a]When I die, halle[a]lujah by and by
    [e]I'll fly a[a]way

verse:
    When the shadows of this life have grown
    I'll fly away
    Like a bird that prison bars has flown
    I'll fly away

verse:
    Oh, how glad and happy when we meet
    I'll fly away
    No more cold iron shackles on my feet
    I'll fly away

verse:
    Just a few more weary days and then
    I'll fly away
    To a land where joys will never end
    I'll fly away
