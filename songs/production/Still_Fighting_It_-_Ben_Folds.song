verse:
    Good morning [c]son I am a [f:maj7]bird
    Wearing a [c]brown polyester [f:maj7]shirt
    You want a [c]Coke? maybe some [f:maj7]fries?
    The roast beef [c]combo's only nine ninety [g]five
    But it's [c]okay, you don't have to [f:maj7]pay
    I've got all the [c]change [g]

chorus:
    Everybody [f]knows it [c]hurts to grow [g]up
    But everybody [f]does, it's so [c]weird to be [g]back here
    Let me tell you [f]what the [c]years go on and
    [g]We're still fighting it, [f]we're still fighting it

bridge:
    And [c]you're so [f:maj7]much like [c]me
    I'm [f:maj7]sorry

verse:
    Good morning son twenty years from now
    Maybe we'll both sit down and have a few beers
    And I can tell you about today
    And how I picked you up and everything changed
    It was pain sunny days and rain
    I knew you'd feel the same things

chorus:
    Everybody [f]knows it [c]sucks to grow [g]up
    But everybody [f]knows, it's so [c]weird to be [g]back here
    Let me tell you [f]what the [c]years go on and
    [g]We're still fighting it, [f]we're still fighting it

bridge:
    You'll [c]try and [f:maj7]try and one [c]day you'll [f:maj7]fly [f:m]
    [c]Away from [f:maj7]me [c] [f:maj7] [c] [f:maj7] [c]

verse:
    [c]Good morning son, [f:maj7]good morning son
    [c]Good morning son, [f:maj7]good morning son
    Good morning [c]son I am a [f:maj7]bird
    [c]Good morning son [g]
    It was [c]pain sunny days and [f]rain
    I knew you'd feel the [c]same [g]things

chorus:
    Everybody [f]knows it [c]hurts to grow [g]up
    But everybody [f]does, it's so [c]weird to be [g]back here
