verse:
    I thought I was [a]smart, I thought I was [cs:m]right
    I thought it [d]better not to [e:2]fight
    I thought there was a [a]virtue
    in [fs:m]always being [e]cool

verse:
    So when it [a]came time to [cs:m]fight
    I thought [d]I'll just step a[e:2]side
    And that [a]time would prove you [fs:m]wrong
    and [e]you would be the [a]fool

chorus:
    I don't [a]know where the [cs:m]sun beams end
    And the [d]star lights [e:2]begin
    It's all a [a]mystery [fs:m] [e]

verse:
    Oh to fight is to defend
    If it's not now then tell me when
    Would be the time
    That you would stand up and be a man

verse:
    For to lose I could accept
    But to surrender I just wept
    And regretted this moment
    Oh that I, I was the fool..

chorus:
    I don't know where the sun beams end
    And the star lights begin
    It's all a mystery
    And I don't know
    How a man decides what's right for his own life
    It's all a mystery

verse:
    'Cause I'm a man, not a boy
    And there are things you can't avoid
    You have to face them
    When you're not prepared to face them

verse:
    If I could I would
    But you're with him, now it'd do no good
    I should've fought him
    But instead I let him I let him take it
