verse:
    [a:m]On a [e]wagon [a:m]bound for [e]market
    [a:m]   There's a [d:m]calf with a [a:m]mourn[e]ful [a:m]eye
    [a:m]   High a[e]bove him [a:m]there's a [e]swallow
    [a:m]   Winging [d:m]swiftly [a:m]through [e]the [a:m]sky

chorus:
    [g]   How the winds are [c]laughing
    They [g]laugh with all their [a:m]might
    [c]   Laugh and laugh the [a:m]whole day through
    And [e]half the summer's [a:m]night
    
chorus:
    [e]Dona, Dona, Dona, [a:m]Dona
    [g]Dona, Dona, Dona, [c]Don
    [e]Dona, Dona, Dona, [a:m]Dona
    [d:m]Dona, Dona, [e]Dona, [a:m]Don

verse:
    Stop complaining, said the farmer
    Who told you a calf to be;
    Why don't you have wings to fly away
    Like the swallow so proud and free?
