    Won't you meet me at the bar, respect big pimpin. Tell me how you feel. Mama tell me what you
    sippin.
    A certified dime piece deserve Louy 1-3. 150 a shot, 3 for you and 3 for me.
    Checkin your body language. I love the conversation. And when you lick your lips I get a tinglin
    sensation.
    Now we're both a bit tipsy. You say you in the mood. All I need is bout a hour, better yet maybe two.
    Let me take you where I live, Ferrari switch gears. When I whisper in your ear your legs hit the
    chandilleeR
    Passion fruit and sex, all in the atmospheeR. Imma let T-Pain sing, so he can make it clear.
