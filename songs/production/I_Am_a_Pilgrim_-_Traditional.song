    And I've got a [a]home in [a]
    That yonder [d]city, good [d]Lord

verse:
    I got a mother
    A sister and a brother
    Who have gone this way
    Before

chorus:
    I am determined
    To go and see them, good Lord
    Over on
    That distant shore

verse:
    I'm going down to
    That river Jordan
    Just to bathe
    My weary soul

chorus:
    If I can just touch
    The hem of His garment, good Lord
    Then I know
    He'll take me home

verse:
    Now when I'm dead
    Laying in my coffin
    All of my friends all gather round

chorus:
    They can say that
    He's just laying there sleeping, good Lord
    Sweet peace
    His soul has found

    Traveling through 
    This wearisome land 
    
chorus:
    And I've got a home in 
    That yonder city, good Lord
    And it's not 
    Not made by hand
