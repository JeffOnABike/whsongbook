    Well she was [e:7]just seven[e:7]teen

verse:
    Well she looked at me, and i, I could see
    That before too long I'd fall in love with her

    She wouldn't dance with another (whooh)

    Well my [a:7]heart went [a:7]boom
    When I [a:7]crossed that [a:7]room
    And I [a:7]held her [a:7]hand in [b:7]mine [a:7]

    Well we danced through the night
    And we held each other tight
    And before too long I fell in love with her
