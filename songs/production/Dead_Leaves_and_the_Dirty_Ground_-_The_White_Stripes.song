verse:
    [a]   Dead leaves and the [g]dirty ground, when I [c]know you're [d]not [a]around [g]
    [a]   Shiny tops and [g]soda pops, when I [c]hear your lips [d]make a [a]sound
    When I [f]hear your lips [g]make a [a]sound [g] [a]

    Thirty notes in the mailbox will tell you that I'm coming home
    And I think I'm gonna stick around for a while so you're not alone
    For a while so you're not alone

verse:
    If you can hear a piano fall, you can hear me coming down the hall
    If I could just hear your pretty voice, I don't think I need to see at all
    Don't think I need to see at all

    Soft hair and a velvet tongue, I want to give you what you give to me
    And every breath that is in your lungs is a tiny little gift to me
    Is a tiny little gift to me

verse:
    [a]   Well any man with a [g]microphone can [fs]tell you what he [f]loves the [a]most [g]

    If you're [f]thinking of the [g]Holy [a]Ghost
