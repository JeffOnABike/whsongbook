    [g:m]Open your eyes, look [bf:7]up to the skies and [ef]see
    [c:m]I'm just a poor boy, [f]I need no sympathy because I'm [b]easy [bf]come, [a]easy [bf]go, [b]little [bf]high, [a]little [bf]low

verse:
    Too late, my time has come, Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time

    At all
