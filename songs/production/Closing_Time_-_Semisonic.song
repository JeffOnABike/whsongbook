verse:
    Closing time, time for you to go out to the places you will be from
    Closing time, this room won't be open till your brothers or your sisters come
    So gather up your jackets, move it to the exits, I hope you have found a friend
    Closing time, every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end (yeah)
    Closing time, time for you to go out to the places you will be from

chorus

outro:
    [g]Closing [d]time, [a:m]every new be[c]ginning comes from [g]some other be[d]ginning's [a:m]end [c g]
