    In Catholic school as vicious as Roman rule
    I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
    And I held my tongue as she told me
    "Son, fear is the heart of love." So I never went back

    You and me have seen everything to see

    It's nothing to cry about, 'cause we'll hold each other soon
