  []Love of mine some day []you will die
  But I'll be []close behind. I'll follow []you into the []dark,
  No []blinding light or tunnels to []gates of white
  Just our hands []clasped so tight, waiting []for the hint of a []spark.
}

\lyrics chorus {
  If []Heaven and Hell de[]cide that they []both are satisf[]ied
  Ill[]uminate the []"no"s on their []vacancy signs
  If []there's no one be[]side you when your []soul em[]barks
  Then []I'll follow []you into the dark []
}

\lyrics verse {
  In Catholic school as vicious as Roman rule
  I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
  And I held my tongue as she told me
  "Son, fear is the heart of love." So I never went back

\lyrics verse1{
  You and me have seen everything to see
  From Bangkok to Calgary, and the soles of your shoes 
  Are all worn down. The time for sleep is now.
  It's nothing to cry about, 'cause we'll hold each other soon
  % Note that there's an extra line here. I've created a separate verse.
  In the []blackest of []rooms [] []
