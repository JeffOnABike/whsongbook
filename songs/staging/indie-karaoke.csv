So the lion ate PierreArriving home at six o'clock His parents had a dreadful shock!They found the lion sick in bed and cried-Pierre is surely dead!They pulled the lion by the hair They hit him with the folding chairHis mother asked-Where is Pierre? The lion answered- I don't care!His father said-Pierre's in there!They rushed the lion into town The doctor shook him up and downAnd when the lion gave a roar Pierre fell out upon the floorHe rubbed his eyes and scratched his head And laughed because he wasn't deadHis mother cried and held him tight His father asked-Are you allright?Pierre said-I am feeling fine Please take me home, it's half past nineThe lion said-If you would care To climb on me, I'll take you thereThen everyone looked at Pierre Who shouted-Yes, indeed, I care!The lion took them home to rest And stayed on as a weekend guestThe moral of Pierre is: CARE!

by the morning they'll be gone.When everything is lonely I can be my own best friendI get a coffee and the paper; have my own conversationsWith the sidewalk and the pigeons and my window reflectionThe mask I polish in the evening, by the morning looks like shit.And I know you have a heavy heart; I can feel it when we kissSo many men stronger than me have thrown their backs out trying to lift itBut me I'm not a gamble you can count on me to splitThe love I sell you in the evening, by the morning won't exist.You're looking skinny like a model with your eyes all painted blackYou just keep going to the bathroom always say you'll be right backWell it takes one to know one, kid, I think you've got it badBut what's so easy in the evening, by the morning is such a drag.I've got a flask inside my pocket we can share it on the trainIf you promise to stay conscious I will try and do the sameWe might die from medication, but we sure killed all the painBut what was normal in the evening, by the morning seems insane.And I'm not sure what the trouble was that started all of thisThe reasons all have run away but the feeling never didIt's not something I would recommend, but it is one way to liveCause what is simple in the moonlight, by the morning never isWhat's so simple in the moonlight, now is so complicatedWhat's so simple in the moonlight, so simple in the moonlight",,3Dy-Na-Mi-Tee,Ms. Dynamite,"reason beat: dynamite 80 bpmbass line:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------9-----9-----------------------------------------------------------------------7-7-7-----------------------7-------7---------------------------------------------------------9----------5-5-5----0--------------------------------------------------Chorus background vocals:I'm Ms. Dy-na-mi-teeI stay blowin' up ur stereo... everybody gotta hear me thoughI'm just Ms. Dy-na-mi-teeHear me bussin' on da radio, now feel my flow... u get me thoughI'm Ms. Dy-na-mi-teeSee me bouncin' in da video, and I come to rock the show-oI'm Ms. Dy-na-mi-teeEverybody loose contro-ol... let my vibe touch your so-oul(after 2nd chorus, bridge: ooh ohh x4)3 verses, 3 chorusesafter 3rd chorus, singer: “I’m just Ms. Dyna” (MUSIC STOPS) “mi-teeee...”",,,"Yo I'm the same little girl that grew up next door to youWent through all the things a teenage girl goes throughHangin' out all night breakin my curfewWhen my daddy hit the door I gave my mumma the bluesUse 2 spend my time blazin' lazin' days awayThought I was grown left home at 15 didn't want to obeyHad 2 get my act together couldn't take the heatAnd now I'm making beats for the streetsCHORUS:I'm Ms. Dy-na-mi-teeI stay blowin' up ur stereo... everybody gotta hear me thoughI'm just Ms. Dy-na-mi-teeHear me bussin' on da radio, now feel my flow... u get me thoughI'm Ms. Dy-na-mi-teeSee me bouncin' in da video, and I come to rock the show-oI'm Ms. Dy-na-mi-teeEverybody loose contro-ol... let my vibe touch your so-oulI remeber all the house parties that took placeBein' in my bed upstairs and we could still feel the baseAnd my cousins and my brothers we'd sit up all nightListenin' to my family vibin' till the mornin' lightRemember my first years of school I was so innocentI just wanted to learn I never been so contentBut the more that I learned I found a guidin lightThat showed me the need to fightAnd beCHORUSooh....  ooh....  x4At 13 I thought I was in love with this guyAnytime I caught his eye I thought that I'd just dieRemember playin' class clown I was a disruptive foolAnd the beatin' I got first time suspended from schoolRemember Sunday School and after go to granmas for lunchMacaroni, rice and peas, chicken and pineapple punchNever had much my mum brother sister and meBut love was enough to succeed to growCHORUSI'm just Ms. Dy-na-mi-tee",,1True Love Will Find You in the End,"Johnston, Daniel (Beck covered it)","intro  G...G G G G C C G G Em Em A A C C C C G G G G G                   G                       G               G True love will find you in the endC                      C                         G               G You'll find out just who was your friendEm                 Em                A            A Don't be sad, I know you willC                       C             C                  C                         G     G     G      G But don't give up until         True love will find you in the endG           G                       G                G This is a promise with a catchC                    C                   G                     G Only if you're looking will it find youG                       G                     G                      G 'Cause true love is searching tooC                        C                     C                                  C       G        G But how can it recognize you?
