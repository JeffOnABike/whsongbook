all the rat-race noise down in the street.On the roof, that's the only place I knowWhere you just have to wish to make it so.And at night the stars they put on a show for freeAnd, darling, you can share it all with me.That right smack dab in the middle of townI found a paradise that's trouble-proof.And if this old world starts a getting you down,There's room enough for two, up on my
