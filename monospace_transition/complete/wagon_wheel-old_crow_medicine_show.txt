Wagon Wheel
Bob Dylan and Old Crow Medicine Show

G                        D
Headed down south to the land of the pines
        Em                   C
And I'm thumbin' my way into North Caroline

G
Starin' up the road
    D                 C
And pray to God I see headlights

I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Pickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm hopin' for Raleigh
I can see my baby tonight

       G                   D
    So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
    Em               C
    Rock me mama any way you feel
    G  D       Em      C
    Hey   mama rock me

    Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
    Rock me mama like a south-bound train
    Hey mama rock me

Runnin' from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old-time stringband
My baby plays the guitar
I pick a banjo now.

Well, the North country winters keep a gettin' me
Lost my money playin' poker so I had to up and leave
But I ain't a turnin' back
To livin' that old life no more

    (Chorus)

And I gotta get a move on fit for the sun
I hear my baby callin' my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh
At least I will die free

    (Chorus)
