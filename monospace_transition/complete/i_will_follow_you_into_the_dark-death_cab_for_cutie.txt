C                     Am
Love of mine some day you will die
            F                         C            G/B
But I'll be close behind. I'll follow you into the dark,

No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
Just our hands clasped so tight, waiting for the hint of a spark.

       Am                C              F             C    G/B
    If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
       Am          C              G
    Illuminate the "no"s on their vacancy signs
       Am                C                 E       Am    G
    If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
         F           Fm           C
    Then I'll follow you into the dark

In Catholic school as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me
"Son fear is the heart of love." So I never went back

    (Chorus)

You and me have seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary, and the soles of your shoes 
Are all worn down. The time for sleep is now.
It's nothing to cry about, 'cause we'll hold each other soon

       Am          F      F  F
In the blackest of rooms

    (Chorus) 
    …and I’ll follow you into the dark.
